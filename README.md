# Foreign Banking App
(THIS IS JUST A PROTOTYPE PROJECT FOR LEARNING AND SHOWCASING SKILLS).

This is a backend application for managing foreign banking transactions. It is built using Spring Boot and MySQL, with Postman being used to test the APIs. The system allows for managing customer accounts, transactions (deposits, withdrawals), and automatically updates account balances in real time.

## Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot**: Java framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MySQL**: Relational database to store customer and banking data.
- **Postman**: Tool for testing the backend APIs.

## Features

- **Manage Bank Accounts**: Create, update, and delete bank accounts for customers.
- **Automatic Account Balance Update**: Whenever a transaction (deposit or withdrawal) is made, the account balance is automatically updated in real-time.
- **Transaction Management**: Record deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts. Transactions are linked to accounts, ensuring accurate tracking.
- **Foreign Currency Support**: Handle foreign currency transactions with proper conversion and tracking.
- **Foreign Key Relationships**: Utilize foreign keys in the database to manage relationships between bank accounts, transactions, and customers.
- **API Endpoints**: Expose RESTful APIs to interact with the banking system, including endpoints for account creation, transaction management, and balance checking.


### Prerequisites
- **JDK 11+**: Ensure that Java is installed on your machine.
- **MySQL**: Have MySQL installed and a database created.
- **Postman**: Use Postman to test API endpoints.
